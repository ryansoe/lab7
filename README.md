1. The best approach is to run automated tests within a Github action whenever code is pushed because this ensures tests are consistently executed in a clean environment without requiring manual intervention, while providing immediate feedback to developers and preventing broken code from being merged.

2. No, unit tests are more appropriate for individual functions

3. Navigation mode analyzes the entire page load process and performance metrics. Snapshot mode only examines the current state of the page without analyzing loading performance or DOM changes.

4. Optimize images (compression, modern formats, proper sizing)
Improve accessibility (alt text, color contrast, keyboard navigation)
Reduce JavaScript bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading
